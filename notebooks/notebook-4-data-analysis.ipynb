    "### Interpreting the results table 👀\n",
    "How does this table help us answer the question? The key section is the middle row, which shows *coefficient estimates* and assosciated statistics. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Coeficient estimates\n",
    "Here the relevant coeficient estimate is the coeficient for `company`. Recall that the basic purpose of a regression analysis is to estimate the coeficients $w_i$ in an equation of the form:\n",
    "$$y = x_1 w_1, \\ldots, x_n w_n$$\n",
    "where $x_1,\\ldots,x_n$ are predictor variables and $y$ is the outcome variable.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When we look at the table above, the coefficient estimates are giving us the model's best guess at the $w_i$ terms. So:\n",
    "\n",
    "*  If the coeficient estaimte for the relevant variable (`company`) is zero, that would tell us that this variable is not predictive of the outcome variable (`satisfaction`), because zero multiplied by anything is equal to zero and therefore **the predictor doesn't influence the outcome** $y$ (here `satisfaction`).\n",
    "*  If the **coeficient estimate is positive**, that would tell us that the company variable had a positive effect on the outcome variable (i.e. increased `satisfaction`)\n",
    "    *  **Note**: in the case of binary categorical predictors (`Giggle` vs `Rubicon`), there is generally assumed to be one *reference* class, and the coeficient tells us about the effect of the other class.\n",
    "    *  Here, the reference class is `Giggle`, and the coeficient tells us about the effect of `Rubicon`. We can see that because the `company` variable in the table states `[T.Rubicon]`\n",
    "*  If the **coeficient estimate was negative**, we would conclude that the variable had a negative impact relative the the reference class, i.e. working at `Rubicon` is assosciated with a decrease in employee satisfaction relative to `Giggle`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Statistical Significance\n",
    "You can also look at the colum `P>|t|` to underestand the statistical significance. \n",
    "\n",
    "If your alpha value for decidiing statistical statistical significance is `0.05`, you would look at the value in the `P>|t|` column and see if it is **smaller than `0.05`** on the relevant row. If you observe a regression coefficient estimate that is statistically significiantly different than zero, you can conclude that the variable has an effect on `satisfaction` in this dataset. The direction of the effect is given by the sign of the coefficient estimate (`-` or `+`). The magnitude of the effect is a complicated quantity, but is related to the absolute value of the coefficient estimate.\n",
